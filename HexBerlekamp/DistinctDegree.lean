/-!
Executable distinct-degree factorization surface for `hex-berlekamp`.

For a monic square-free input `f`, the executable loop computes the successive
gcds with `X^(p^d) - X mod f`.  Each non-unit gcd is recorded as the degree-`d`
bucket, and removed from the residual polynomial before the next degree is
tested.

Repeat one degree test against the current residual, multiplying every
non-unit gcd into the same degree bucket before the outer loop advances.

For square-free inputs this records at most one factor.  For repeated-factor
inputs it preserves FLINT-style bucket multiplicities: if a degree-`d`
irreducible factor appears several times, every copy is stripped while the
same Frobenius difference is active.

Predicate used by the bucket invariant theorem: the recorded
factor divides the corresponding `X^(p^d) - X mod f`. The unnormalised
executable `DensePoly.gcd` does not return `bucket.factor` literally on the
left of `gcd bucket.factor (frobeniusDiffMod ...) = bucket.factor` (e.g.
`gcd X (2*X) = 2*X` over `F_3`), so the morally-correct invariant is the
divisibility statement that `gcd_dvd_right` already supplies.

# Same-degree extraction divisibility

`finishDegreePower` and `distinctDegreePowerLoop` both emit at most one bucket
recording the accumulated product of repeated same-degree gcds against the
fixed Frobenius difference `diff`.  After the first iteration the bucket
factor is no longer literally `gcd residual diff`, so divisibility by `diff`
needs more than `DensePoly.gcd_dvd_right`: it follows from a step-preserved
invariant on `(residual, acc)` whose construction (the square-free /
multiplicity content) is delegated to the caller.

`finishDegreePower_bucket_dvd_diff` covers all three exit cases of
`finishDegreePower`; including the scalar-unit residual case where the
emitted factor is `acc * residual`.

`distinctDegreePowerLoop_bucket_dvd_diff` threads an abstract
step-preserving predicate `P : FpPoly → FpPoly → Prop` through induction
on the fuel.  Concrete instantiations (e.g. "`acc ∣ diff` together with a
square-free residual coprime to `acc`") feed the divisibility, the unit
finish case, and the gcd-extraction step into the three hypotheses
`hP_acc_dvd`, `hP_finish_unit`, and `hP_step`.
