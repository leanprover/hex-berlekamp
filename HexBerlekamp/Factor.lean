Executable Berlekamp split-step factoring for `hex-berlekamp`.

This module exposes the single-witness split primitive `gcd(f, h - c)`, then
builds the
public Berlekamp factorization driver by computing the fixed-space kernel once
and repeatedly applying those witnesses to the current factor list.

/--
Search the Berlekamp split candidates `gcd(f, h - c)` over all constants
`c : F_p`, returning the first nontrivial factorization found.

A witness `w` can only split `f` when `w mod f` is nonconstant: every
candidate `gcd(f, w - c)` reduces to `gcd(f, (w mod f) - c)`, which is `f`
or a unit (never a proper factor) once `w mod f` is a field constant.  The
leading `(witness % f).size ≤ 1` guard skips the whole `p`-wide constant
sweep in that case; the dominant cost once a factor is already irreducible,
since every kernel witness is then constant modulo it.  The guard is
value-preserving: `kernelWitnessSplitAux_none_of_mod_size_le_one` proves the
skipped sweep would have returned `none` (over a field), so this agrees with
the unguarded search at every input.  When the current factor has positive
degree and is strictly smaller than the original witness, the sweep also
resumes each GCD from this cached remainder with the reference execution's
remaining fuel; `cachedSplitAux_eq` proves the exact representative and result
are unchanged over a prime modulus, which is the intended domain of this
Berlekamp API.  This cannot be an `@[csimp]` swap: the optimized aux has an
extra cached-remainder argument and its equality proof needs `PrimeModulus`,
so the reference aux instead remains intact behind an explicit equality.

/--
Fully split a single factor into its witness-irreducible pieces.

Once `splitWithWitnesses?` reports that `f` admits no kernel-witness split,
`f` is irreducible and is emitted as a leaf; the recursion never re-tests
it. Polynomials of size at most two are emitted immediately: the split loop's
proper factor must be nonconstant and strictly smaller, which is impossible
for a polynomial of degree at most one. Each side of a successful split
recurses independently, so an already-irreducible factor is tested against
the witnesses exactly once
(the former restart-from-front loop re-tested every irreducible factor on
every pass). The fuel bounds the recursion depth; `f.size` strictly
decreases at every split, so `f.size + 1` fuel reaches the
witness-irreducible leaves.

The output preserves the depth-first, factor-before-cofactor order of the
former loop, keeping the factor multiset *and its order* identical.

/--
Budget for the residue scan of the root-extraction path. Two tests, both read
off the degree and the field size alone, so the decision is deterministic and
reads nothing about the coefficients of `f`.

`deg f ≤ p` is *necessary*: `F_p` has `p` elements, so a polynomial with
`deg f` distinct roots in `F_p` cannot have degree above `p`. A scan of a
higher-degree input can never succeed, so it is never started.

`25 * p ≤ (deg f)^2` keeps the scan cheap against the work it would replace.
The scan is one Horner evaluation per residue, `p * deg f` modular
multiplications; the fixed-space matrix multiplies `deg f` polynomials modulo
`f`, each product quadratic in the degree, so about `(deg f)^3`. The test
therefore admits the scan only when it costs about a twenty-fifth of the matrix
build alone. Measured on the diagnostic grid of issue #9157, an
admitted-but-rejected scan costs between 0.8% and 2.3% of `berlekampFactor`,
falling as the degree grows.

Together the two tests select `5 √p ≤ deg f ≤ p`: a completely split image is a
plausible thing to meet only when the degree is comparable to the field size.

/--
The root-extraction path: enumerate the roots of `f` in `F_p` and, when there
are `deg f` of them, return the corresponding monic linear factors.

A squarefree `f` splits into distinct linear factors exactly when it has
`deg f` roots in `F_p`, and the scan is its own certificate: the length test is
what makes the result sound, so no separate complete-splitting test is computed
and no Boolean is trusted unchecked. `Hex.Berlekamp.eq_foldl_rootsIn_of_length`
turns the length test into the reconstruction `∏ (X - rᵢ) = f`.

Returning `none` costs the scan; `rootScanBudget` bounds that cost.

/--
Compute the Berlekamp factorization of a monic polynomial over `F_p`.

There is one selection point. When the residue scan is affordable and finds
`deg f` roots, `f` is the product of the corresponding monic linear factors and
those are returned directly. Otherwise the fixed-space kernel of `Q_f - I` is
built and the input is fully split with the resulting kernel representatives.
Both branches return factors whose product is `f`; the theorems below are
proved for the two branches separately and stated only about
`berlekampFactor`. The root-extraction branch emits monic linear factors; the
kernel branch emits raw gcd leaves, monic only up to a unit, whose
irreducibility comes from `berlekampFactor_factors_irreducible` on a
square-free input.

/-! # Invariance of the split search under a unit scaling

The factors returned by `berlekampFactor` are raw `gcd` outputs, hence
defined only up to a unit scalar.  To feed them to the monic-divisor
completeness theorem we transport the "no kernel-witness split" fact from a
nonzero polynomial `g` to its monic associate `scale c g` (`c ≠ 0`).  The
split search compares each candidate `gcd(g, w - C k)` against `g` only
through its size and degree, both of which are preserved when `g` is replaced
by an associate, so the search returns `none` for `g` exactly when it does for
`scale c g`. -/

`kernelWitnessSplit?` skips the full `p`-wide constant sweep when

`gcd(f, witness - c)` is then either an associate of `f` or a unit, never a
proper factor, so the skipped `kernelWitnessSplitAux` sweep would have
returned `none`. -/

/-! # Witness-irreducible leaf structure

`fullySplit` emits a factor as a singleton leaf exactly when it admits no
kernel-witness split, and a successful split produces two nonempty subtrees.
So the output is always nonempty, and a length-≤-1 output means the input
itself admits no split; every fixed-space kernel witness yields
`kernelWitnessSplit? = none`. This isolates the executable side of Berlekamp
completeness; the algebraic implication "no kernel-witness split implies
irreducibility" lives in a separate finite-field module. -/

/-! # Every returned factor resists all kernel-witness splits

The completeness theorem for monic divisors needs, for each returned factor,
that no fixed-space kernel witness splits it.  This is structural for
`fullySplit`: a factor is emitted only as a witness-irreducible leaf, where
`splitWithWitnesses?` already reported `none`.  The `f.size + 1` fuel never
runs out before the leaves, because `size` strictly decreases at every split. -/

/-- **Per-factor no-split.** With enough fuel (`f.size ≤ fuel`) every factor
emitted by `fullySplit` admits no kernel-witness split; it was emitted exactly
because `splitWithWitnesses?` returned `none` on it. -/
